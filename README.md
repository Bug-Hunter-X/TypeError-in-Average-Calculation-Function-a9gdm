This repository contains a Python code example demonstrating a common error: a TypeError when calculating the average of a list containing non-numeric elements. The bug.py file shows the problematic code, which fails if the input list includes strings or other non-numeric data types. The bugSolution.py file provides a corrected version that handles such cases gracefully, either by using error handling or by filtering out non-numeric elements. This is a crucial example in understanding how to handle unexpected data types in Python to prevent runtime errors.
